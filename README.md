##  Scoring & Analytics

Each session tracks and reports:

- **Longest Correct Streak**  
- **Per-Topic Accuracy** (if `Topic` column exists)  
- **Per-Difficulty Accuracy** (if `Difficulty` column exists)

- **Summary Stats** ‚Äî strengths, weaknesses, recommendations  
- **Copyable ‚ÄúMissed Questions‚Äù Set** ‚Äî for flashcard apps or manual review

##  Persistent History

After every `End Session`, the system outputs a **History Block** in CSV format, e.g.:

```
date_time,question_id,topic,difficulty,outcome,source,session_id
2025-10-20T14:25:32Z,aws-001,Security,Medium,Correct,csv,Session-7
```

### To save your history:
1. Copy the entire CSV block into a text file.  
2. Save as `quiz_history.csv` in your project folder.  
3. Next session, it‚Äôll be automatically loaded and merged.

---

##  Extended Questions

During sessions, the system may fetch **(Extended)** questions from the web to include fresh AWS topics, new service updates, or realistic scenario questions.  
These are marked clearly and included in scoring.

---

##  Example Workflow

1. Upload:
   - `flashcards.csv`
   - All course transcripts
   - Optional `quiz_history.csv`
2. Start a GPT-5 chat with the prompt.
3. Run:
   ```
   Begin Session
   ```
4. Answer questions. Use `hint`, `skip`, or `end session` anytime.
5. When finished, copy the **History Block (CSV)** and save it as `quiz_history.csv`.
6. Re-upload next time to keep long-term stats.

---

##  Tips
- Keep your **flashcards.csv** clean and organized ‚Äî consistent topic and difficulty tags make analytics more useful.  
- Regularly **Review Missed Questions** or run **Spaced Review** sessions to lock in weak areas.  
- Back up your `quiz_history.csv` to maintain lifetime performance data.  
- Add new transcripts or course materials anytime ‚Äî the system automatically integrates them.
