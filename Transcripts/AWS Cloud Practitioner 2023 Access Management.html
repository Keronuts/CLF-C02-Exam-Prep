<p>It is an established fact of cloud security that a large aspect of daily responsibilities involves monitoring, controlling, and optimizing Identity and Access Management of cloud resources and services. In fact, Identity and Access Management is at the top of the AWS Security Triad pyramid, the other two being Infrastructure Security and Key Management. In this course, we&#39;ll learn about AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). We&#39;ll discover the new IAM Identity Center.

Presented by: Michael Shannon.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>Well, we can&#39;t talk about Identity and Access Management at Amazon Web Services without first exploring the least privilege principle. Least privilege is the principle that a security architecture should be utilize so that each subject, otherwise known as a principal, is granted the minimum system resources and authorizations that the entity needs to conduct its activities, and nothing more. When related to data and information, this is often called the &#34;need to know&#34; principle. At Amazon Web Services, this is often applied with the role-based access control (RBAC) model unless federated single sign-on (SSO) is being used. When setting permissions with Identity and Access Management policies, grant only the permissions necessary to perform the task.</p>
<p>In other words, only allow the API calls through the AWS Customer Metastructure to the resources in AWS data centers needed to achieve a specific goal. This is accomplished by defining the actions that can be taken on specific resource objects under certain conditions. Administrators often begin with broader permissions, then subsequently explore the permissions that are needed for a particular workload or use case. This least privilege principle is also referred to as the least privilege strategy or LPS. It&#39;s common for users to have broader or elevated permissions using their own on-premises identity provider but have lesser privileges with resources in the cloud. A critical element of a Zero Trust initiative (ZT) is to adopt a least privilege strategy (LPS) that enforces access control to eliminate the human temptation to access restricted resources.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="section_2" tabindex="-1"></div><h2 class="section_title">3.

Presented by: Michael Shannon.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this lesson, we&#39;re going to talk about protecting the root account at AWS. The root account is a standalone single sign-on unrestricted access entity. Notice on the Sign in page, the interactive user logging on to the console has the choice of signing in as the Root user or as a user created in the Identity and Access Management service of AWS. When the customer first creates an AWS account, they begin with a single sign-in entity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password used to create the account.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the password is long and strong and well-protected. Keep in mind that the password policy that may be configured in the IAM service does not apply to the root account. The root account is subject to the AWS default password policy, which can change over time. Customers are strongly discouraged from using the root user for everyday tasks (even the administrative ones). Root user credentials should only be used to perform a few account and service management tasks. Some of the distinctive activities that can only be performed by the root account user would include changing the support plan, for example, from a business plan to an enterprise on-ramp plan. Modifying payment options and billing, adding a credit card, removing a debit card, or going to direct billing. This includes creating an organization, closing an AWS account.</p>
<p>Signing up for AWS GovCloud in the United States, transferring a Route 53 domain to another account. This can only be done by the root account user. And creating an AWS-created X.509 signing certificate. The root account should not be accessed programmatically. In other words, the root account user shouldn&#39;t get an access key ID and an access key and then manage the account through a command line interface. If they have been created, then delete them immediately. And always use a physical or software-based multi-factor token access on the root account. We will look at multi-factor authentication options at Amazon Web Services and a lesson coming up later on in this course.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="section_3" tabindex="-1"></div><h2 class="section_title">4.

<p>OK, in this demonstration, we&#39;re going to look at the Identity and Access Management managed service at Amazon Web Services. This is a great solution for small teams, small businesses, development teams. This is not the most robust and scalable solution that we have at Amazon Web Services. We&#39;re going to look at the Identity Center in our next demonstration. But here we see the IAM Dashboard and we can also see a couple of things. I&#39;m actually logged in as the root account user.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A tab titled Dashboard | IAM | Global is displayed on the browser. There is a toolbar at the top, containing a Services icon, a search bar, a Cloudshell icon, a notification icon, and so on. The navigation pane on the left titled &#39;Identity and Access Management (IAM)&#39; displays an option called Dashboard at the top along with several collapsible sections like Access management, Access reports, and so on. The Access Management section contains various options like User groups, Users, Roles, Policies, Account settings, and so on. The main pane displays the title &#39;IAM Dashboard&#39; at the top, followed by 2 sections labeled IAM resources and What&#39;s new. To the right, 4 sections appear: AWS Account, Quick Links, Tools, and Additional information.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And generally speaking, that&#39;s not a good idea. But this is just a test account, OK. So, I don&#39;t use this for any other reasons other than training, but typically you would not log in as the root user. I do use multi-factor authentication.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll also talk about that later on in this course. But I definitely don&#39;t use any access keys to access the Amazon Web Services resources as a programmatic user. So, the way that this is usually set up is kind of a role-based access control approach where you have what are called User groups. So, you would have groups based on whatever that could be roles, that could be members of a initiative or a program or a project or whatever, you know, this is basically it&#39;s your discretion. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The User groups page is open on the main pane. It displays a few options at the top like refresh, Delete, and Create group. A search bar appears next followed by a table with 4 column headers labeled Group name, Users, Permissions, and Creation time. The table lists the following 3 items: Auditors, Managers, and Production.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />You set up the groups. Now the groups are going to get what are called Policies. Now a policy is a managed JSON document. So, if we look at PowerUserAccess, we&#39;ll break this out here. It is a JavaScript Object Notation document and it&#39;s basically an Allow list. So, it says, what are the API calls that are allowed for this particular policy?<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Policies page is open on the main pane. It displays a few options at the top like refresh, Actions, and Create policy. A search bar appears next followed by a table with a few column headers like Policy name, Type, Used as, Description, and so on. The table displays several items like AdministratorAccess, PowerUserAccess, ReadOnlyAccess, and so on. A plus icon is available next to each item. The icon next to PowerUserAccess item is selected. It expands into a panel. The panel displays the title &#39;PowerUserAccess&#39;. A tab labeled Copy appears at the top right corner. Below, a JSON is displayed, containing several lines of code.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And so, these are created by Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>And early on, these are the ones you&#39;re going to use. And these basically are Allow lists that say when I assign this, let&#39;s say PowerUserAccess to a group like let&#39;s say Production, then those are the API calls the Production group can make. And typically, to be scalable and centralized, we create groups and then we place Users into those groups.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Users page is open on the main pane. It displays a few options at the top like refresh, Delete, and Create user. A search bar appears next followed by a table with several column headers like User name, Path, Groups, Last activity, and so on.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />So, if I Create a user, I can give that user a name, we&#39;ll say SAM, there&#39;s a couple of choices to make here for this user. <br /><br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A page titled Specify user details appears. The navigation pane on the left displays the following 3 steps: Specify user details, Set permissions, and Review and create. The first step labeled Specify user details is active now. The main pane displays a section called User details. It contains a field labeled User name and a checkbox labeled Provide user access to the AWS Management Console - optional. At the bottom, 2 tabs labeled Cancel and Next are displayed.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And this goes back to what we talked about in the previous lesson about least privilege. You have to take the least privilege approach when you are doing identity management. So, generally speaking, we&#39;re not going to give a user Management Console access and programmatic access by giving them these access keys to use for a wide variety of user cases like in the command line interface.</p>
<p>Usually, they&#39;re one or the other, OK, so they&#39;re going to be a Management Console user or they&#39;re going to be a programmatic user. That&#39;s the least privilege principle. It should be very rare that a user gets both of those and we definitely don&#39;t give programmatic access to the root account user. But let&#39;s say, I want to create an IAM user and on the exam there is no configuration. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The checkbox labeled Provide user access to the AWS Management Console - optional is selected. A section titled &#39;Are you providing console access to a person?&#39; appears. It displays a field called User type. It contains 2 radio buttons: Specify a user in Identity Center - Recommended and I want to create an IAM user. The radio button labeled &#39;I want to create an IAM user&#39; is selected. Below, a field called Console password appears. It contains 2 radio buttons titled &#39;Autogenerated password&#39; and &#39;Custom password&#39;. A checkbox titled &#39;Users must create a new password at next sign-in - Recommended&#39; appears next.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />OK, I&#39;m just kind of showing you this is a show and tell and conceptually. But the point I&#39;m making is when I click on Next, they&#39;re going to say, you know, put them in a group because the group, whether it be auditors or managers or production, it already has an attached policy which says basically what API calls it can make.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The navigation pane on the left now highlights the second step titled &#39;Set permissions&#39;. The main pane displays a section called Permissions options at the top. It displays 3 radio buttons labeled Add user to group, Copy permissions, and Attach policies directly. Below, 2 sections appear: User groups and Set permissions boundary - optional. The User groups section displays 2 options at the top: refresh and Create group. A search bar appears next followed by a table with 4 column headers: Group name, Users, Attached Policies, and Created. The table lists the following items: Auditors, Managers, and Production.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Or I could Copy the permissions from somewhere else, or I could apply them directly to a user, but we don&#39;t generally do that because it&#39;s not scalable. I&#39;m going to Cancel out of here because there&#39;s no configuration on the exam. So, you do know that a managed policy is just a set of JSON documents that gets applied to an entity and you can apply up to 10 of them. So, you could stack them. So, you could apply basically 10 policies even though we really overdoing it because really they come in three kind of categories, administrator, type users, power users, and then like auditors like ReadOnlyAccess users. So generally, applying 10 of these to either a Group or a User or we&#39;re going to talk about Roles here in a moment. That&#39;s usually not done. You can usually accomplish it with two or three apply different policies.</p>
<p>Now, one of the first things you&#39;re going to do, generally speaking, is go to the Account setting and set up the Password policy. So, on the exam, they may want you to know that the default password policy has a minimum length of 8 characters. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Account settings page is open on the main pane. It displays a section called Password policy at the top. An Edit tab is available in the title bar of the section. Below, various information is provided under 3 fields: Password minimum length, Password strength, and Other requirements. Another section labeled Security Token Service (STS) appears next.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />In fact, the minimum is 8 and the maximum is 128, so you could edit that or change that. You could say I&#39;m not going to use the default policy, I&#39;m going to customize it with different types of requirements.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Edit tab is selected. A corresponding page titled &#39;Edit password policy&#39; appears. It displays a section called Password policy. The section contains 2 radio buttons: IAM default and Custom. The Custom radio button is selected. Below, 3 fields appear: Password minimum length, Password strength, and Other requirements. At the bottom, 2 tabs labeled Cancel and Save changes are displayed.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Maybe you don&#39;t want to require at least one uppercase letter or lowercase letter or number or non-alphanumeric character. You also have things like what&#39;s the password expiration, you know, 30 days, 45 days, 90 days. If you want to Allow them to change their own password and Prevent password reuse, this is like a password history. So, they have to do let&#39;s say if you put 10 in here, they have to do 10 unique passwords before they can reuse a password.</p>
<p>This only applies to IAM. The password policy does not apply to the root account user. The root account user is subject to the default password policy. Keep that in mind. And also, if you&#39;ve already created users and groups, the next time they log in, they will have to, you know, create a new password that adhears to the new policy. Now Roles are entities that are just something that you assign permissions to.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Roles page is open on the main pane. It displays a few options at the top like refresh, Delete, and Create role. A search bar appears next followed by a table with a few column headers like Role name, Trusted entities, Last activity, and so on. Below, numerous items are displayed. The Create role option is selected.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So, you could have a role that&#39;s used, let&#39;s say, on an EC2 instance of Linux for example, and anybody who&#39;s logged on to that Linux EC2 instance or Windows or macOS, that instance assumes that role, and anybody on that machine can only do the API calls that you get based on the permissions that you assign. This is something else that managed policies also get attached to, not just user groups, individual users, but a role.</p>
<p>And the common use cases are to say I want to assign this role to an EC2 instance or a Lambda function so that way you can control basically with that JSON allow list exactly what API calls they can make. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A page titled Select trusted entity appears. The navigation pane on the left displays 3 steps: Select trusted entity, Add permissions, and Name, review, and create. The first step labeled Select trusted entity is active now. The main pane displays a section called Trusted entity type. It contains 5 radio buttons: AWS service, AWS account, Web identity, SAML 2.0 federation, and Custom trust policy. A section titled &#39;Use case&#39; appears next. It displays 2 fields: Common use cases and Use cases for other AWS services. The Common use cases field contains 2 radio buttons: EC2 and Lambda. At the bottom, 2 tabs labeled Cancel and Next appear.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br /><br />But you can also create a role for, you know, another AWS account. In fact, later on in this course, I will explain to you cross-account roles and how they&#39;re done, and why they&#39;re done. But we&#39;re not going to go any farther than that. Just realize that a role is just a trusted entity that ultimately you assign permissions to, right?</p>
<p>So, when I click on Next, it&#39;s going to ask me, you know, what type of managed policies do I want to assign to that role? And then users can assume that role or an instance of something or a Lambda function. So, that&#39;s the IAM service. That&#39;s really all you need to know for the exam. In the next demonstration lesson, we&#39;ll go look at the Identity Center, which used to be called AWS Single Sign-On or AWS SSO, but now it&#39;s much more than that. And that&#39;s probably the solution that most organizations are going to use as they&#39;re moving away from the traditional IAM-managed service.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="section_4" tabindex="-1"></div><h2 class="section_title">5.

Presented by: Michael Shannon.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In the previous lesson, we did a demonstration of the Identity and Access Management service at Amazon Web Services. Realize for the exam that organizations customers of AWS are recommended to use the IAM Identity Center previously known as AWS Single Sign-On as the preferred gateway for identity management, managing workforce access to multiple AWS accounts and your applications running in the cloud. If we go down here, we can see some of the benefits. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A page titled IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) is displayed. There is a toolbar at the top, containing a Services icon, a search bar, a Cloudshell icon, a notification icon, and so on. The title bar at the top displays a box labeled Enable IAM Identity Center. It contains some information and an Enable tab at the bottom. Below, several sections appear such as Getting started, Benefits and features, Use cases, and so on. To the right, there are two sections titled &#39;Getting Started&#39; and &#39;More resources&#39;. The Getting Started section contains 2 hyperlinks: Get started with IAM Identity Center and IAM Identity Center prerequisites. The More resources section contains 4 hyperlinks: Documentation, FAQ, IAM Identity Center forum, and Contact us.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />This is where you connect your existing directory or you can use the built-in Identity Center directory. And this is basically what I showed you in the previous lesson, user groups, users and roles. You can have application assignments in the Identity Center to give your workforce an easy and scalable way to access enabled applications, and there&#39;s a lot of applications that are supported.</p>
<p>So, as far as the exam is concerned, Identity Center is the gateway to AWS accounts and cloud applications for your workforce users. If we go up here if you were to try to Enable this, they&#39;re going to tell you first off that you have to be in an organization, so it requires AWS Organizations<br /><br />. [Video description begins] <em>A dialog box titled &#39;Enable IAM Identity Center&#39; appears. It offers various information. At the bottom, 2 tabs titled Cancel and Create AWS organization appear.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />This is a test account that I&#39;m using, so I haven&#39;t set up an organization in direct billing on this account. But we&#39;ll notice also, if we go to Get started, we&#39;ll want to know kind of some of the prerequisites.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Get started with IAM Identity Center hyperlink is selected. A corresponding page opens with the title: Getting started. It displays a section called Topics. Below, several hyperlinks are listed such as Prerequisites and considerations, Step 1: Enable IAM Identity Center, Step 2: Choose your identity source, Step 3: Create an administrative permission set, and so on.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />One of those, of course, as we just saw is you have to be in an organization. Also, if you&#39;re already managing users and groups in Active Directory or some external identity provider, let&#39;s say, like Octa or maybe Azure AD, then they&#39;re going to say, we recommend that you consider connecting whatever it is when you enable IAM Identity Center and choose your identity source.</p>
<p>And then it says, look, if you&#39;re already using AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory, then you have to enable Identity Center in the same AWS Region where your directory is set up. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A page titled &#39;Prerequisites and considerations&#39; is displayed. At the top, a header called Topics appears. It contains hyperlinks to the following 2 sections of the page: Are you new to AWS? and Prerequisites and considerations for specific environments. The Prerequisites and considerations for specific environments section displays the header Topics. It again contains the hyperlinks to the following 4 sub-sections: Active Directory or an external IdP, AWS Organizations, IAM roles, and Next-generation firewalls and secure web gateways.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Also, you have to be in an organization, and we established that already. Also, we talked about roles. Remember, a role is just an entity that you assigned managed permissions to. We saw that in the previous lesson. And they&#39;re telling you if you&#39;ve already configured roles in your AWS account, you should check whether you&#39;re getting close to your quota because there is a quota or limit. And obviously, if you&#39;re going to enable this Identity Center, you&#39;ll be creating and using leveraging more roles. If you go back, once you Enable the IAM Identity Center, then you have to choose an identity source.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Getting started page reappears. The following hyperlink is selected: Step 2: Choose your identity source.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And this is really the last thing I want you to see here in this lesson because there&#39;s no configuration on the exam. Your identity source in IAM Identity Center defines where your users and groups are managed, so you should know that these are the three main sources. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The corresponding page titled &#39;Step 2: Choose your identity source&#39; opens. The page provides various information. There are 3 bullet points displayed: Identity Center directory, Active Directory, and External identity provider.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />You can use an Identity Center directory. So, When we enable it for the first time, it&#39;ll automatically configure with a default directory as the default identity source. Here&#39;s where you create your user groups and your users and then you assign their level of access to accounts and applications and you do that with managed policies. Remember those JSON allow lists or Active Directory, OK. You would choose this option if you want to continue managing users in either your AWS Managed Microsoft AD service or maybe you have your own self-managed directory in Active Directory on-premises. Either way, they provide connectors to do that and to integrate with the Identity Center.</p>
<p>Or maybe you have some other External identity provider like I mentioned already, Octa, Azure Active Directory, but there are quite a few others like IdRamp and other marketplace partners that you can use. Now, it does say if you&#39;re already managing users and groups in Active Directory or you&#39;re using something like Octa, AWS recommends that you consider connecting this source when you enable Identity Center and choose that as your identity source. And you want to do that before you start creating any new groups or any users in the Identity Center directory or making any assignments with managed policies, those JSON documents. That&#39;s a good idea. So, this is really all you need to know. But remember that really the IAM Identity Center is the gateway of choice. It&#39;s the option of choice for federated single sign-on access to accounts and applications running in Amazon Web Services. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A page titled AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) is displayed. There is a toolbar at the top, containing a search bar, an option called Contact Us, a tab labeled Return to the Console, and so on. Below, 2 boxes appear, offering information on the following hyperlinked titles: IAM Identity Center User Guide and IAM Identity Center API Reference. A pop-up pane titled &#39;On this page&#39; appears on the right. It contains a list of Related Links available on this page such as: AWS Glossary, Getting Started with AWS, SDKs &amp; Tools, and so on.</em> [Video description ends]</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="section_5" tabindex="-1"></div><h2 class="section_title">6.

Presented by: Michael Shannon.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>OK, in this demonstration lesson, we have 4 main topics. First the topic of access keys at AWS, then password policies. But I already kind of blew the lid on password policies. Remember when I talked about IAM earlier in this course under Account settings, I showed you the Password policy area. So, actually, I&#39;ve already covered that in a previous lesson so we&#39;re not going to redo that again.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The tab titled Dashboard | IAM | Global is open. There is a toolbar at the top, containing a Services icon, a search bar, a Cloudshell icon, a notification icon, the profile name drop-down, and so on. The navigation pane on the left titled &#39;Identity and Access Management (IAM)&#39; displays an option called Dashboard at the top along with several collapsible sections like Access management, Access reports, and so on. The Access Management section contains various options like User groups, Users, Roles, Policies, Account settings, and so on. The main pane displays the title &#39;IAM Dashboard&#39; at the top, followed by 2 sections labeled IAM resources and What&#39;s new. To the right, 4 sections appear: AWS Account, Quick Links, Tools, and Additional information.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>But as I look at this, there&#39;s also what&#39;s called a Security Token Service. So, let me mention this. The STS is used to create and provide trusted users. So, remember we have trusting where the resources are and then the trusted users with temporary security credentials.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Account settings page is open on the main pane. It displays a section called Password policy at the top. An Edit tab is available in the title bar of the section. Below, various information is provided under 3 fields: Password minimum length, Password strength, and Other requirements. Another section labeled Security Token Service (STS) appears next. It contains 2 headers: Session Tokens from the STS endpoints and Endpoints. Under the Session Tokens from the STS endpoints header, 2 fields appear: Global endpoint and Regional endpoints. Below, the Endpoints header, there is a table with 3 column headers: Region name, Endpoint, and STS status.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Now, later on in this course, I&#39;m going to talk about cross-account roles. And when we get the cross-account roles, that&#39;s actually what&#39;s being used, the Security Token Service to grant that trusted entity access to resources in another account. So, it&#39;s actually using the STS service. So, I want to show you that while I&#39;m there, but what I do want to show you is access keys.</p>
<p>So, if you&#39;re going to be a user, let&#39;s Create a user, Let&#39;s say this user is going to be SAM-ADMIN.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Users page is open on the main pane. It displays a few options at the top like refresh, Delete, and Create user. A search bar appears next followed by a table with several column headers like User name, Path, Groups, Last activity, and so on.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A page titled Specify user details appears. The navigation pane on the left displays the following 3 steps: Specify user details, Set permissions, and Review and create. The first step labeled Specify user details is active now. The main pane displays a section called User details. It contains a field labeled User name and a checkbox labeled Provide user access to the AWS Management Console - optional. At the bottom, 2 tabs labeled Cancel and Next are displayed.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />If you&#39;re going to not use a console and this is going to be a programmatic user, they&#39;re going to tell you SAM, who&#39;s going to have programmatic access, has to have an access key. Now, if you&#39;re an external user of AWS and you want to do anything programmatic like use a Command Line Interface, you&#39;d go to aws.amazon.com/cli Command Line Interface and you would download the 64-bit installer. Because there used to be a 32-bit installer, but they don&#39;t have one of those anymore.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A page titled &#39;AWS Command Line Interface&#39; displays. The address bar at the top reads: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/. A toolbar appears next with various options and tabs. The navigation pane on the left, contains 2 sections: RESOURCES and RELATED LINKS. Below, there is a box labeled Get Started with AWS for Free. It contains a button called Create Free Account. The main pane displays information and 4 icons with the following hyperlinks: Getting Started, AWS CLI Reference, GitHub Project, and Community Forum. The pane on the right contains several sections like Windows, MacOS, Linux, Amazon Linux, and so on. The sections contain the respective hyperlinks: 64-bit, MacOS PKG, Linux installer, and Amazon Linux AMI.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />It&#39;s just 64-bit installer or the MacOS PKG installer or a Linux installer.</p>
<p>And they&#39;ve got a couple of others, like for example, if you&#39;re using Amazon Linux, like the Amazon Linux AMI, Amazon Machine Image, like Amazon Linux 2, it comes preinstalled on that image. That&#39;s kind of cool, right? So for example, I downloaded the 64-bit installer onto my machine because I&#39;m going to do programmatic access. So, I&#39;m going to be some type of user, maybe SAM-ADMIN. And what&#39;s going to happen is as I go through this process, I&#39;m going to send this administrative user, this programmatic user, an access key ID, which is kind of a pseudorandom username for the access key, and the access key has to be used. So, here&#39;s how it would work. I would go download the Windows 64-bit installer and I would run it and I would install it.</p>
<p>Then I would run my console or command.exe and I would run aws configure. Now on the exam, there&#39;s no configuration, but I just want you to know what has to be done here. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A Windows command prompt window appears. The following command is added: aws configure.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So, in order to use the CLI, I have to have an access key that is going to digitally sign all of the application programming interface request or calls that I make to AWS. Technically, it&#39;s called through the metastructure to the controller that&#39;s been exposed to me in a data center in some zone somewhere, and it&#39;s going to be in a regional context. What I would do is I would take the email that I got and it would have the access key ID in it and I would copy and paste it in here and then it would ask me for the access key itself. And that&#39;s also in the email.</p>
<p>So, I would copy and paste that into here and then it&#39;s going to ask me what is the default region you want to work in. So for me, I might choose the Ohio Central region or the Northern Virginia region. And the reason I would do that is because then I don&#39;t have to come into the Command Line Interface every session and say I want to be in this region or that region. You have to tell them what region you want to work in so they know which Availability Zone and which data center in that zone you want to work in because you&#39;re accessing those resources programmatically. And then the final thing they&#39;re going to ask you is the Default output format. If I just say None, then it&#39;s going to default to JSON. So, JSON would be when I&#39;d issue AWS commands, so it would be AWS followed by the service I want to work in, S3, EC2, DynamoDB, whatever.</p>
<p>Those JSON statements are what I&#39;ll be working in. Now, you could do table if you don&#39;t know JSON, and I would say if you don&#39;t know JSON you&#39;re going to have to learn it definitely as a cloud practitioner, but in the beginning, you might want to do the table format which is much easier to work with if you don&#39;t want to do the default JSON. So, once you set this up, then all of your API calls that you make are going to be digitally signed with the key derived from this Secret Access Key. We call that forward secrecy. So, you&#39;re getting a key, a session key, temporary key that&#39;s derived from this access key, and that&#39;s what it&#39;s digitally signing, the API call that you send to the AWS metastructure. And that&#39;s how access keys work.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A command is inserted in the Default output format [None] field. It reads: table.</em> [Video description ends] </p>
<p>One of the use cases, but the most popular use case for access keys at AWS. So I&#39;m going to cancel out of here and we&#39;re going to go look at another service that you need to be aware of called the Systems Manager. This is another popular service to use at AWS to manage, for example, EC2 instances and applications.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Users page reappears. The following is entered in the search bar at the top: Systems Manager.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A page titled AWS Systems Manager is displayed. There is a toolbar at the top. It contains a Services icon, a search bar, a Cloudshell icon, a notification icon, the profile name drop-down, and so on. The title bar at the top displays a tab labeled Get Started with Systems Manager. The navigation pane on the left titled &#39;AWS Systems Manager&#39; displays an option called Quick Setup at the top along with several collapsible sections like Operations Management, Application Management, Change Management, Node Management, and so on. The Change Management section contains various options like Change Manager, Automation, Change Calendar, and so on. The Node Management section contains options like Fleet Manager, Compliance, Inventory, Session Manager, and so on. The main pane displays a section called &#39;How it works&#39; at the top. To the right, a section called More resources appears.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />There&#39;s quite a few things under the Systems Manager, but only a couple I want to mention here. One is the Change Manager, and this is actually one you would use with the aforementioned AWS IAM Identity Center. Because when you&#39;re using Identity Center, often for those federated users, those single sign-on users, they&#39;re also going to be subject to change management in the cloud.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The main pane displays the title &#39;Change Manager&#39; at the top, followed by a few sections like Getting started, Benefits and features, and so on. To the right, 3 sections appear: Get started with Change Manager, Use cases, and More resources.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So as they request, approve, implement, and report on operational changes, it can all be managed within System Manager, Change Manager, and it helps you automate your workflow, reduce errors of operational changes. This is basically cloud-based change and configuration Manager. So, that&#39;s one of the services of Systems Manager that&#39;s very important.</p>
<p>You&#39;ve also got a couple of others. Session Manager is also a very popular solution. So, instead of using, let&#39;s say some kind of bastion host to access your instances, Session Manager basically sets up an initial Secure Shell 2 handshake and you&#39;re going to run an agent on your EC2 instance of Windows or Linux. It does an initial Secure Shell handshake and then from that point on you don&#39;t have to have a bastion or a jump host. You don&#39;t have to open up Secure Shell or remote PowerShell ports. There&#39;s no certificates or Secure Shell keys to manage. It&#39;s all done for you under the hood, so we kind of call this confidential computing. But it&#39;s also a way to get secure access to your Windows and Linux instances from within Amazon Web Services, and it&#39;s a very powerful tool.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The main pane displays the title &#39;Session Manager&#39; at the top, followed by 2 sections labeled How it works and Why use Session Manager? To the right, 3 sections appear: Start a session, Getting started, and More resources.</em> [Video description ends] </p>
<p>Now, there&#39;s other options, for example, if you&#39;re single sign-on through Identity Center and you have Active Directory, in that case, you&#39;re probably going to use a service called AppStream 2.0. And AppStream 2.0 is the single sign-on bastion service that you would use to Stream desktop applications securely to any web browser. So, this is the service you would use in your single sign-on Active Directory environment. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A page titled Amazon AppStream 2.0 is displayed. There is a toolbar at the top. It contains a Services icon, a search bar, a Cloudshell icon, a notification icon, the profile name drop-down, and so on. The navigation pane on the left titled &#39;AppStream 2.0&#39; displays several options like Stacks, Fleets, Images, User Pool, Directory Configs, and so on. The main pane displays several sections such as How it works, Benefits and features, Use cases, and so on. To the right, 4 sections appear: Get started, Pricing, Documentation, and More resources.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />They really frown on using a jump host or a bastion host that you deploy, let&#39;s say out in a public subnet. That&#39;s just not secure. It&#39;s usually not subject to patch management very well, so they&#39;re going to offer these other services that you&#39;re going to use instead of that. Now, another thing to be aware of on the exam is the Secrets Manager.</p>
<p>And there&#39;s a concept that we talk about when we&#39;re using application programming interfaces or restoring code up in a repository, and that is, you don&#39;t embed any credentials into an API call. You don&#39;t store secrets or keys or credentials with your code. You always want to make a secure call to a service that stores those. And that&#39;s what Secrets Manager does. It stores, rotates, monitors, and controls access to secrets like database credentials, like API keys. Or maybe you&#39;re using OAuth tokens, which are very popular with mobile apps today, as opposed to using kind of older methodologies.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A page titled &#39;AWS Secrets Manager&#39; is displayed. There is a toolbar at the top. It contains a Services icon, a search bar, a Cloudshell icon, a notification icon, the profile name drop-down, and so on. The navigation pane on the left titled &#39;AWS Secrets Manager&#39; displays an option called Secrets. The main pane displays several sections such as How it works, Benefits and features, and so on. To the right, 3 sections appear: Get started, Pricing, and Additional information. The Get started section contains a tab called Store a new secret.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So it can do this for you. And so if you go down and you say, Store a new secret, you&#39;ll see your options. So, you&#39;ve got Credentials for Amazon RDS databases, so Relational Database Service. We&#39;re talking about MySQL, Postgres, MariaDB, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. Credentials for an Amazon DocumentDB database, Credentials for your data warehousing in your Amazon Redshift cluster, or other databases, or Other types of secrets like API keys with key-value pairs or OAuth tokens that you use with mobile devices and mobile apps.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A page titled Choose secret type appears. The navigation pane on the left displays the following 4 steps: Choose secret type, Configure secret, Configure rotation, and Review. The first step labeled Choose secret type is active now. The main pane displays a section called Secret type. It contains 5 radio buttons: Credentials for Amazon RDS database, Credentials for Amazon DocumentDB database, Credentials for Amazon Redshift cluster, Credentials for other database, and Other type of secret. Another section titled &#39;Credentials&#39; appears next. It contains fields like User name, Password, and so on. At the bottom, 2 tabs labeled Cancel and Next are displayed.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The radio button labeled Other type of secret is selected. Below, 2 new sections appear: Key/value pairs and Encryption key.</em> [Video description ends] </p>
<p>So, the Secrets Manager is that kind of one-stop shop that all of these different applications in databases and services are making their own API call to get that token or that key or those database credentials as opposed to you storing them in the database or storing them in the mobile app or storing them in the code repository. So, this is the AWS Secrets Manager. Another thing to be aware of on the exam, the Systems Manager, the Secrets Manager, and also if we go back remember to my account up here we have that Security credentials which I already showed you earlier. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The profile name drop-down menu displays the Account ID at the top. Below, a few options are displayed such as Account, Organization, Service Quotas, Security credentials, and so on.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />But remember this is where you have My security credentials, where you have the Multi-factor authentication, where you could create access keys.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m not going to do that because this is the root account that I&#39;m logged into and you should never create access keys for the root account user. OK, that&#39;s just way way vulnerable. But I could create access keys for other administrative users and then they can send programmatic calls, you know, from the CLI, from PowerShell tools, Software Development Kits, or just direct API calls from your application. And you can only have two access keys active or inactive at a time. So, on the exam, those are the areas to be aware of. Not configuration, nothing too deep, but just conceptually from a definition standpoint.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Security credentials page is open on the main pane. It displays the title &#34;My security credentials&#34; and a label Root user at the top. Below, several sections appear such as Account details, Multi-factor authentication (MFA), Access keys, and so on. The Multi-factor authentication (MFA) section displays 3 tabs at the top: Remove, Resync, and Assign MFA device. Below, a table appears with the following column headers: Device type, Identifier, Certifications, and Created on. It displays an item called Hardware TOTP token. The Access keys section displays a Create access key tab at the top.

Presented by: Michael Shannon.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />OK, I&#39;m back up at the IAM Dashboard and we&#39;re going to talk about multi-factor authentication in this lesson. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The tab titled Dashboard | IAM | Global is displayed. There is a toolbar at the top, containing a Services icon, a search bar, a Cloudshell icon, a notification icon, the profile name drop-down, and so on. The navigation pane on the left titled &#39;Identity and Access Management (IAM)&#39; displays an option called Dashboard at the top along with several collapsible sections like Access management, Access reports, and so on. The main pane displays the title &#39;IAM Dashboard&#39; at the top, followed by 2 sections labeled IAM resources and What&#39;s new. To the right, 4 sections appear: AWS Account, Quick Links, Tools, and Additional information.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Now, I&#39;m the root user. Again, do as I say, not as I do, but I&#39;m the root user and I am using multi-factor authentication. In fact, for this, I&#39;m using a Gemalto SafeNet One Time Password Display Card. And I went bought it on Amazon.com and I registered it by going up here to the Security credentials.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The profile name drop-down menu displays the Account ID at the top. Below, a few options are displayed such as Account, Organization, Service Quotas, Security credentials, and so on.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>You&#39;ll notice that I do have an Assigned MFA device, and this is the Hardware TOTP token that I just mentioned. Basically, what you do is when you register it, you would go Assign MFA device, go ahead and put in the serial number on the back of the Gemalto card. And then they&#39;re going to have you press the button on the front, which gives you 6 digits and you&#39;re going to enter that in a couple of different times. So if we see Assign MFA device, you&#39;ll name it. And then they give you several options.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Security credentials page is open on the main pane. It displays the title &#34;My security credentials&#34; and a label Root user at the top. Below, several sections appear such as Account details, Multi-factor authentication (MFA), Access keys, and so on. The Multi-factor authentication (MFA) section displays 3 tabs at the top: Remove, Resync, and Assign MFA device. Below, a table appears with the following column headers: Device type, Identifier, Certifications, and Created on. It displays an item called Hardware TOTP token.</em> [Video description ends] </p>
<p>You can use an Authenticator app, for example, a lot of people will use something like Google Authenticator. There&#39;s other things that might be used, QR codes, for example, like IdRamp there security keys like YubiKey or other supported FIDO security keys, or a Hardware TOTP token. And again that&#39;s the one I just mentioned. I used a Gemalto card and I selected that. So, you should know these three categories for the exam Authenticator app or a Security key like YubiKey, or maybe a Hardware token. Now, the Hardware token just has a one-to-one relationship with the account. So like my Gemalto card, it&#39;s basically only useful to log on as the root user for this account. If I use an Authenticator app or I use a Security key like YubiKey, those can be used for multiple accounts at Amazon Web Services. Let me show you this real quick, this is just one of the pages you would go through.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A page titled Select MFA device appears. There is an info link available next to the page title. The navigation pane on the left displays the following 2 steps: Select MFA device and Set up device. The first step labeled Select MFA device is active now. The main pane displays a section called MFA device name at the top. It contains a field called Device name. Another section titled &#39;MFA device&#39; appears next with 3 radio buttons: Authenticator app, Security key, and Hardware TOTP token. At the bottom, 2 tabs labeled Cancel and Next appear.</em> [Video description ends] </p>
<p>If I went back here and like wanted more information, Info, it would bring me here. So, they recommend that you use multi-factor authentication. In fact, you should use it for any user. Definitely the root account user, but any IAM user that has the ability to change or create anything like that, you know they recommend that highly. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A new tab opens on the browser. It displays a page titled &#39;Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) in AWS&#39;. There is a toolbar at the top, containing a search bar, an option called Contact Us, a tab labeled Return to the Console, and so on. The page displays various information below. It contains a section titled &#39;What is MFA?&#39;.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So here&#39;s the categories of the FIDO security key part of the FIDO Alliance so you can see the list of the FIDOCertified products here. These won&#39;t be on the exam specifically. Virtual MFA devices, so that would be something like Google Authenticator and you could see the list of those as well. And then the Hardware TOTP. TOTP is the protocol, basically time-based one-time password. So, that&#39;s the TOTP algorithm and that&#39;s what&#39;s used, for example, by my Gemalto card.</p>
<p>Now, TOTP is also used by virtual MFA devices as well. So, if you&#39;re using let&#39;s say Google Authenticator app, well it&#39;s going to use the TOTP algorithm. And that might be something you want to know for the exam. Now, it also tells you down here that SMS text message-based multi-factor authentication, AWS ended support for that a while back, right? So, you should be switching away from the SMS text-based approach, to one of these token devices, FIDO security key, Virtual MFA devices, or Hardware TOTP token.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="section_7" tabindex="-1"></div><h2 class="section_title">8. Video: Cross-account Roles (it_clawsp23_06_enus_08)</h2><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/public/b/0f1d2cf8-c41a-44e0-973f-467301ceda6f/image001.jpg" alt="" role="presentation" width="300" onclick="(()=>document.getElementById('lb-image').src = 'https://cdn2.percipio.com/public/b/0f1d2cf8-c41a-44e0-973f-467301ceda6f/image001.jpg')();" /><div class="section_text">After completing this video, you will be able to define cross-account roles.</div><div class="section inner"><h3 class="list_title"></h3><ul class="list"><li class="list_item">define cross-account roles</li></ul><div class="section_text">[Video description begins] <em>Topic title: Cross-account Roles. Presented by: Michael Shannon.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In AWS Identity and Access Management, a role is just a logical object that has permissions assigned to it. Now, we know that our managed policies are just JSON documents that serve as allow lists of what API calls can be made. In other words, what can an entity do through the metastructure in the controller in the data center of Amazon Web Services? Here we see that a policy, a JSON document with a set of API allows can be applied to a group, for example, the admins group in account A, and that&#39;s very common. This is scalable and more centralized. We create users Amber and Max and we just place them in the group and they assume the policy. Now, a policy can also be assigned directly to a user.</p>
<p>For example, we can assign the PowerUserAccess policy to Gina in account B and the AdministratorAccessPolicy to a user Cody in account B. We can also assign the PowerUserAccess policy to a single user Lucas in account A. However, that&#39;s only done on a limited basis, and really for a small group or a small account. What we&#39;re talking about here though is that a managed policy can actually be assigned to a role. A role is a logical object, it&#39;s just a container, and you can assign a policy to that role. In fact, you can assign up to 10 policies to a role or a group, or a user and it would be the aggregate or the accumulation of all of the API calls that are allowed in the JSON documents.</p>
<p>With roles, we assign the policy to the role and then some entity will assume that role and they&#39;ll be able to access with a token the resource for a certain period of time and only be able to do the API calls that are in the managed policy. On the exam, you&#39;ll be tested on cross-account roles. So, let&#39;s say, we have two accounts. We have the development account on the right-hand side and the production account on the left-hand side. In the development account, we have two groups, the Developers group and the Testers group. And in the production account, we deploy our live applications. Let&#39;s say in the development account, we have a user named Ted. We want to give Ted access to a S3 bucket in the production account called myapp.</p>
<p>What we&#39;re not going to do is we&#39;re not going to create another user called Ted in the production account, which happens to be the trusting account. It&#39;s where the things are that&#39;s the one that&#39;s going to be trusting Ted. So, the way a cross-account role works is this. You create a role in the trusting account or the production account called myapp, and it&#39;s just simply a role or a container, and then you assign permissions to that role, manage permissions. In other words, what API calls can somebody who assumes that role in the production account? Once that&#39;s done, an administrator in the development account will actually assign that role to Ted, and then Ted will temporarily assume that role, get a token, and then access that S3 bucket for a certain period of time, but only making the API calls against that S3 bucket in the production account that he&#39;s allowed to do based on the manage permissions assigned to the role in the trusting account that he&#39;s assumed. That&#39;s how cross-account roles can work.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="section_8" tabindex="-1"></div><h2 class="section_title">9.
