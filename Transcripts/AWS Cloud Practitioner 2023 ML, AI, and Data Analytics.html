<p>Machine learning, or ML, assists organizations in generating growth, discovering new revenue streams, and fixing challenging issues. Data is a critical success factor (CSF) in business decision-making, and companies have typically leveraged data from various sources, such as customer feedback, their employees, finance, and external consultants.</p>
<p>Machine learning research automates and optimizes this process. Businesses can get results quicker by using code that analyzes very large data sets at high speeds. Some machine learning use cases are: Manufacturing- to support predictive maintenance, quality control, and inventive research in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>ML technology also assists companies in improving logistical solutions, supply chain disruptions, and inventory control such as JIT, Just-in-Time. Healthcare and life sciences- the explosion of wearable sensors has resulted in a substantial amount of health data being generated.</p>
<p>Machine learning solutions can analyze the data and support physicians, and other healthcare professionals in performing real-time diagnosis and treatment. Financial services- projects enhance risk analytics and regulation adherence.</p>
<p>ML technology can help investors recognize new prospects by analyzing stock market trends, appraising hedge funds, or adjusting portfolios. Retail- ML initiatives can improve customer service, stock or inventory management, upselling, and cross-channel marketing.</p>
<p>Media and entertainment- this sector uses ML to better appreciate their target audiences and distribute immersive, tailor-made or bespoke, and on-demand content. ML algorithms are used to help design trailers and other advertisements, offer customers content recommendations, and streamline production.</p>
<p>There&#39;s four main machine learning algorithms. Supervised machine learning, is where data scientists offer algorithms with branded and distinct training data to evaluate for correlations. Unsupervised machine learning- this is a technique that trains on unlabeled data by scanning new data and establishing significant links between the inputs and predetermined outputs.</p>
<p>Semi-supervised learning- this combines supervised and unsupervised learning by leveraging a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to train the ML system. And reinforcement machine learning- this is a technique that associates reward values with the different steps that the algorithm must follow.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, there is a difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence. In a nutshell, AI is a domain of computer science focused on solving cognitive problems universally associated with human intelligence: learning, problem solving, and pattern recognition. Although AI can often invoke robotics or even futuristic dystopian panoramas, it transcends the automatons of science fiction into the non-fiction of modern-day advanced computer science.</p>
<p>AWS offers ready-made intelligence for customer applications and workflows with pre-trained AI services. These AI services effortlessly integrate with applications to support common use cases such as personalized recommendation engines; contact center modernization; safety and security enhancement; and customer engagement improvement.</p>
<p>AWS AI services leverage the same deep learning technology that powers Amazon. Customers attain quality and accuracy from continuously learning application programming interfaces without the need for machine learning experience.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="section_2" tabindex="-1"></div><h2 class="section_title">3.

<p>All right, in this short video, we&#39;re going to do a web safari up to Amazon Web Services and talk about Amazon Kinesis, which is a fully managed service allowing you to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data to get timely insights and react quickly to new data. Data becoming information, information becoming knowledge.</p>
<p>Kinesis ingests real-time data like video, audio, application logs, website clickstreams, and more recently, IoT, Internet of Things telemetry data from machine learning, for analytics, and other applications. Amazon Kinesis is a very popular service to run, behind an API gateway. <br /><br />On the exam, be familiar with these four main use cases: Building video analytics applications- securely streaming video from camera-equipped devices in homes and businesses, and public places for security monitoring, face detection and face recognition and other analytics.</p>
<p>Moving away from just batch jobs to real-time analytics- performing real-time analysis on data, for example, sharing data between different applications and streaming ETL. You can use Kinesis for real-time applications such as application monitoring, fraud detection, and live leader-boards. And process streaming IoT device data, for example, sending real-time alerts from medical IoT, or manufacturing IoT, to take other actions programmatically.</p>
<p>For example, when a sensor exceeds operating thresholds. It may be on the exam that you have to define four different Kinesis products. You have Kinesis Video Streams, to securely stream video from connected devices.

<p>AWS Glue. AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easier to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources.</p>
<p>Glue is used for analytics, machine learning, and application development. AWS customers can use Glue to discover and connect to over 70 varied data sources; manage data in a centralized data catalog; and visually create, run and monitor ETL- extract, transform, and load pipelines, to load data into data lakes.</p>
<p>Some of the Glue data sources include S3, DynamoDB, Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), database running on EC2 instances, and other databases, and SaaS providers or AWS marketplace providers. [Video description begins] <em>A flowchart containing four boxes is displayed on the screen. The first box is titled Data sources and lists various data sources in it. This is connected u to the second box titled Choice of interfaces which in turn is connected to a third box titled Data integration engines using to and fro arrows. The second box is also connected to a fourth box containing data lakes and data warehouse options.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Glue&#39;s open interfaces support interactive and job workloads. You can choose between different interfaces such as AWS Glue Studio, Amazon SageMaker notebooks, or other notebooks and IDEs, Integrated Development Environments.</p>
<p>Then you can choose a preferred serverless, scalable data processing engine such as AWS Glue for Ray, AWS Glue for Python Shell, or AWS Glue for Apache Spark, with automatic scaling, and pay-as-you-go pricing, ultimately sending the data to Amazon Redshift data warehousing, S3 data lakes, or other data warehouses.</p>
<p>If you’re going to use Amazon S3 with AWS Glue, a popular solution, simply load the new data into an S3 bucket, then, initiate one or more ETL jobs. [Video description begins] <em>A flowchart labelled AWS Glue is displayed on the screen. It contains 6 boxes and the first box titled Amazon S3 is connected to another titled AWS Glue. This connects to a box titled AWS Glue ETL which connects to two buckets that load transformed data into the target data store: Amazon Redshift and Amazon S3. Underneath, there are also processes happening simultaneously. These include AWS Glue Data Catalog, that manages data, and also, Amazon Cloudwatch, that monitors logs and notifications.</em> [Video description ends] You can use the AWS Glue Data Catalog to manage data, with the data catalog serving as a central metadata repository.</p>
<p>You can use AWS Glue ETL to schedule the ETL jobs to transform and load the data. You can monitor logs and push notifications to Amazon CloudWatch, and then ultimately load your transformed data into your targeted data store- an Amazon Redshift cluster, or an Amazon S3 bucket.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="section_8" tabindex="-1"></div><h2 class="section_title">9.

<p>In this lesson, we’re going to look at Amazon EMR, and that’s what we call it on the exam because it&#39;s not called Amazon Elastic MapReduce anymore. And correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I think Elastic MapReduce was the original Google search engine, memo to check me on that.</p>
<p>However, today, EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data solution for petabyte-scale data processing, interactive analytics, and machine learning. EMR utilizes open-source frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Presto.</p>
<p>Amazon EMR Serverless is a new option in EMR. It makes it simple and cost-effective for engineers and analysts to run applications built using open-source big data frameworks like the aforementioned Spark, Hive, or Presto. And there&#39;s no need to tune, operate, optimize, secure, or manage clusters.</p>
<p>With EMR, you can easily run these three platforms and other big data workloads. [Video description begins] <em>The screen displays a flowchart with three boxes. The first box contains the title Amazon EMR and it is connected to the second box which lists open-source frameworks. This in turn is connected to another box containing lists of tools such as Amazon SageMaker Studio, AWS Step Functions, and so on.</em> [Video description ends] Choose your open-source big data framework and version, and then run applications using open-source frameworks on EC2, Elastic Kubernetes Services, AWS Outposts, or completely serverless.</p>
<p>Then with EMR, you can develop, run, visualize and debug data pipelines, analytics, and data science applications, SQL queries, and machine learning workloads using familiar tools like Amazon SageMaker Studio; Amazon EMR Studio; Amazon MWAA, which is Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow, which you won&#39;t need to know about on the exam, but it is in the diagram, so that’s what it is- Manage Workflows for Apache Airflow; AWS Step Functions; or self-managed tools.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="section_10" tabindex="-1"></div><h2 class="section_title">11.
